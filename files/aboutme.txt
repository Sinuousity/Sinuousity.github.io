Hi there!
<br>
I am Thomas, a human being currently residing in Austin, Texas.
I have been playing videogames most of my life and have been developing them as a hobby for the last decade or so.
<br>
<br>
What you see here are <i>just a few</i> of the projects and visual effects I have created.
<br>
<br>
Primarily self-taught, I am a programmer with experience across low and high level applications.
Although my specialty is GPU programming, I have worked on every aspect of game design and many aspects of software in general.
I have experience with complex visual effects, gameplay scripting, networking, sound design, 3D modeling, animation, graphic design, UI/UX, and more.
<br>
<br>
I have spent over a decade working in the Unity game engine.
I have experience with both desktop and standalone VR/XR applications as well as with mobile deployment.
I have a thorough understanding of machine learning with some implementation/working experience.
<br>
<br>
I have also spent time learning Godot and GDScript (although I very much prefer C#).
<br>
<br>
Outside of game development, I worked for several years using Excel, Microsoft365, SharePoint, AWS, and other business data tools and platforms as a Reporting Analyst for Meta.
In my role at Meta, I maintained the project's databases, designed and developed internal tools, and handled various data requests including employee forecasting.
<br>
Of course, check out my <a class='overlay-link' style='cursor:pointer;text-decoration:underline;' onclick='closeOverlay(); showOverlay("RESUME");'>résumé</a> if you're interested in a more complete list of my skills and experience.
<br>
<br>
During my time working with game engines, I have become adept at using a variety of creative tools to breathe life into my projects.
This includes Blender for 3D models (and video editing), Photoshop & GIMP for texture and graphic design, and FL Studio to create music and sound effects.
You can find some examples of my graphic design work on the page for my <a class='overlay-link' href='{{LINK:ASSETSTORE}}' target='_blank'>SciFi Signs Unity asset</a>.
I have also produced a variety of instrumental music over the years which you can find on my <a class='overlay-link' href='{{LINK:SOUNDCLOUD}}' target='_blank'>SoundCloud</a>, though this is not my focus.
<br>
<br>
Finally, I made the website you are looking at, including the <a class='overlay-link' href='{{LINK:STREAMHUB}}' target='_blank'>StreamHub</a>,
a tool for live-stream creators to add several different interactive elements for their communities.
If you're interested in a real example of what I can do with Javascript (NO 3rd party frameworks!), HTML, and CSS, the StreamHub is where you want to look!
It will give you a good idea of my experience designing and developing user interfaces, particularly for the web.
The StreamHub tool is served alongside this site via GitHub Pages (static content only) and runs entirely client-side in the browser.
When you visit the StreamHub, you can find the menu at the bottom left to start looking around.
